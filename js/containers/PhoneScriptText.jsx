                I urge the Senator to vote YES on the Sanders-Lee resolution S.J.Res. 54 this week, and NO on the Young-Shaheen resolution S.J.Res. 55, which includes vague language that could backfire and make it easier for the United States to provide unconstitutional military aid to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen."
