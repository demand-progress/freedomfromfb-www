            	<p>Most of us use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Theyâ€™re important ways for us to communicate and connect with each other. </p>
            
            	<p>But Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power. Facebook <strong>unilaterally decides the news</strong> that billions of people around the world 
            	see every day. It buys up or <strong>bankrupts potential competitors</strong> to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice. It <strong>tracks us almost 
            	everywhere we go</strong> on the web and, through our smartphones, even where we go in the real world. It uses this intimate data hoard to <strong>figure out how to addict 
            	us</strong> and our children to its services. And then Facebook <strong>serves up everything about us</strong> to its true customers -- virtually anyone willing to pay for 
            	the ability to convince us to buy, do, or believe something.</p>
            
            	<p>And it is <strong>spending millions on corporate lobbyists</strong>, academics, and think tanks to ensure <strong>no one gets in their way</strong>.</p>
            
            	<p>Enough.</p>
            
            	<p>The five members of the Federal Trade Commission, which is the part of our government tasked with overseeing Facebook, can make Facebook safe for our democracy by 
            	breaking it up, giving us the freedom to communicate across networks, and protecting our privacy.</p>
            
            	<p>Together, we will make sure that they do.</p>
